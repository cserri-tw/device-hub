device-hub
-----------


Takes output from one or many IOT devices using various protocols (HTTP, MQTT) and expands it either transforming it into JSON format and/or adding in some metadata.
The logic to transform the data is written in java-script.

```javascript
function decode (input) {

    console.log("decode called")
    return input
}
